# Code Style Guidelines

---

Now that we will be working on large, long running projects with multiple
developers, it is essential that we all work in a unified way in order to:

* Write maintainable code
* Keep code transparent and readable
* Keep code/projects scalable

## Table of Contents

* [Purpose](#purpose)
* [Project Structure](Project%20Structure/)
* [Languages](Languages/)
  * [CSS](Languages/css.md)
  * [HTML](Languages/html.md)
	* [JavaScript](Languages/javascript.md)
  * [Objective-C](Languages/objective-c.md)

## Purpose

No matter the project, we must always try and keep a common formatting. This
means consistent commenting, consistent syntax and consistent naming.

## Adding to These Guidelines

If you find yourself coding frequently in a language not listed or one with 
insufficient guidelines, please write up a proposal following industry standard
best practices (include personal preferences only if the practices are 
ambiguous or still being developed) and submit a pull request.

Limit your markdown files to a maximum 80 character width where possible.
Exceptions may be made for URLs. Thereâ€™s nothing we can do about those.
